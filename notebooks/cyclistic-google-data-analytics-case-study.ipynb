Since Chicago experiences inclement weather, lowest usage is in the winter with rentals starting to ramp up in the spring.  Peak usage is in the summer (August) before it starts to decline again during the Fall.  \n","\n","## Act\n","\n","#### Your top three recommendations based on your analysis\n","\n","First, let's revisit the key business task:  *discover how casual riders and Cyclistic members use their rental bikes differently.*   \n","\n","It appears that members rent bikes for regular commuting---perhaps to work or school.  This is based on the observation that the number of rides is fairly consistent day over day (Table 1) as is the average ride duration (Table 2).  \n","\n","Conversely, casual user rentals are lower Monday through Thursday and trend upwards starting on Friday and peaking on the weekend (Table 1).  This seems to indicate using the bikes for leisure activities such as touring the city, sightseeing, etc.  Additional data that supports this is the longer average ride duration (Table 2).  \n","\n","My three recommendations for the new marketing strategy are as follows:  \n","1. Offer a weekend-only membership at a different price point than the full annual membership to entice casual users towards a full annual membership.  They can only unlock bikes on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.  \n","2. Create a \"See our City\" campaign targeted to casual users that includes 52 suggested routes that will cover all of the major sights in Chicago---one for each weekend.  Casual riders *could* rent as they go, but they could see their city in one year (and save money!) for the price of an annual membership.  \n","3. Be sure that any campaigns are out to the market in the summer when ridership is at its annual peak."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"R","language":"R","name":"ir"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":"r","file_extension":".r","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","name":"R","pygments_lexer":"r","version":"3.6.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
